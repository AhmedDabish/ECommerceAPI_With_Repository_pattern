# ECommerceAPI_With_Repository_pattern

E-Commerce API (ASP.NET Core 8)

This is a simple project I built to review and apply the concepts of Repository Pattern, DTOs, and AutoMapper in a real-world practical example.
The project is an E-Commerce API, which simulates the backend of an online store and includes multiple models such as Product, Category, and Customer.
My main goal was to focus on keeping the codebase clean, well-structured, and easy to extend in the future..
